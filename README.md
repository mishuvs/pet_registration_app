Pet Registration App
===================================

This app displays a list of pets and their related data that the user inputs.
I built upon the initial starter code provided in the Android Basics ND, and improvised the app. Main aim was to learn to implement content provider in an app.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android SDK v24
- Android Build Tools v23.0.3
- Android Support Repository v24.1.1

Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
